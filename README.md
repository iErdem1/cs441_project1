## Project Description

- This is very first iOS mobile application project for university project.
- Technologies: 
	- Swift 4.2.1
	- XCode 10.1 Build Version: 10B61
- Main idea of the project is learning and adopting mobile environment and playgrounds. This was my first experience on any mobile platform, so migration was not easy. I choose Swift basically for no reason. I just wanted to see native iOS environment. On next project I am planning to use ObjectiveC to explore and learn different ones. 
- Project basically aim to learn object types and objects in Swift and understanding basic syntax differences. Also, if you check th code, you can see action assignation examples. 
- Moreover, I fundamentally understand file hierarcy in Swift.
